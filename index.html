<p>Local government is on the brink of a significant shift in the way business is done.  We now live in an age where perpetual “do more with less” proliferates and this trend will not reverse.  This has created a landscape where many cities and towns have decaying infrastructure, too few employees, and great employees that, for the most part, lack experience with technologies that can be used to facilitate or automate the do more with less culture.  Worse, because of budget situations many towns, cities, and communities lack the budget dollar to train and educate the very people they employ to do more with what they have.  This cycle will continue to lead to an ever-increasing gap between the needs of the citizen and the town, city, and/or communities abilities to meet them.  The landscape is ripe for change!  Enter the “super citizen”.</p>

<h3>
<a name="super-citizen" class="anchor" href="#super-citizen"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Super Citizen</h3>

<p>A “super citizen” (queue the superman t-shirts) is a citizen that sees this growing problem for the opportunity it creates.  Super citizens are willing to invest their time, energy, and expertise to make their community a better place.  They are willing to take the time to contribute what they know in an open and reusable way such that others in the community can learn, grow, and in-turn share that same information with others.  The vast majority of them are not-technical.  In fact, all citizens should have the ability to become inspired by a super citizen and contribute; creating another super citizen.  This cycle repeats and change happens.</p>

<p>The paragraph above is based on the principle that people are fundamentally good, are willing to help and share, and a grassroots organized community will police itself.  In 2013 we know this to be true because of the inherent success of community platforms like Ebay, AirBnb, Etsy, and others.  All that is needed is a platform for citizens to engage.  A way for them to contribute.  In fact, at the federal level GitHUB is being used in unique and interesting ways to drive engagement on policy or other issues between citizens and agencies (see CFPB, White House).  The problem, though, is inherently local.  We all are affected everyday by where we live more so than policy makers in washington whether we decide to accept it or not.  So lets start there, lets create a bunch of super citizens together.</p>

<h3>
<a name="here-is-my-idea" class="anchor" href="#here-is-my-idea"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here is my idea:</h3>

<p>I want to build a platform around citizens in a community where they are able, using the devices they are most familiar with (web/mobile), do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask and answer questions related to the community
** gamification incents people to answer, voting determines effectiveness of the answer
** community polices the content</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism for city employees to push questions and answers to an FAQ to drive avoidable contact ($ savings)</li>
<li>Provide a forum (similar to we-the-people) for local change issues to be identified and discussed</li>
<li>Voting and signing (like a petition)</li>
<li>sharing on social</li>
<li>petition send to council</li>
<li>Community Projects (no budget for a project? organize a community group and fundraise or self fund and organize)</li>
<li>Integrate public data-sets like crime, zoning &amp; planning, and the like</li>
<li>This platform should allow a citizen to indicate where they live, work, and play and be localized using mobile technology
** drive into a city and see the issues and questions</li>
<li>Free for Citizens, Free for Cities - citizens create and deploy their “city forum”</li>
<li>Integrate blight-status data (partner)</li>
<li>Scales Globally</li>
<li>Open Source (anyone contributes), but hosted as one platform for data-reuse</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="lets-go" class="anchor" href="#lets-go"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Let's Go!</h3>

<p>There is a role for the city to play, but the lion-share of the work needs to be citizen powered for success.  Ideation platforms approach this process from an idea standpoint but ultimately put the power for performance back into the hands of the city.  Let’s turn that around.  Let’s organize, answer each others questions, discuss the real issues our community faces, then work with the city in a respectable fashion with the power of many super citizen voices and make real change.  </p>

<p>Let’s start today, and let’s start with your town.  In fact, every city in the world should have a FAQ entry for “Where do I go to get food if I can’t pay/am homeless?”, “How do I get help if I am being bullied, raped, or taken advantage of?”  That’s the baseline.  Help me build this platform.</p>
